# MathCompiler
A handcrafted, dependency-free math compiler in vanilla JavaScript. Features a custom lexer, AST generator, and step-by-step evaluator—with support for implicit multiplication and nested expressions. Designed as an educational tool to explore the AST lifecycle, not for production use. Fully decoupled core (compiler.js) + two UIs (GUI &amp; CLI)
